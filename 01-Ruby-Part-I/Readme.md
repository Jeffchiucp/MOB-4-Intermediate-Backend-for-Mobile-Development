# Introduction to Ruby Part I

## Objectives

We are going to cover the basics of Ruby in a 2 part series. These are some of the topics we will cover:

- Variables & Symbols
- Classes, Modules, Objects & Methods
- Collections: Arrays, Hash maps
- Strings: concatenation, interpolation
- Control flow and iteration
- Debugging
- The Ruby REPL
- Using libraries: importing
- Error Handling
- Closures aka Blocks

# Why Ruby

Before we get started with Ruby, lets look at Ruby language and discuss why its important to learn it.

macOS ships with Ruby.

Ruby History here

Ruby is the language to build Rails applications. Ruby is to Python as Rails is to flask.

Ruby is a scripting language and is used extensively to build scripts for running.

Here are a few things built with Ruby:

- Homebrew
- Rails
- Cocoapods
- Fastlane

### How much Ruby do I need to build a Rails application?

For this course, we will only need basic Ruby which we are going to cover. If you have programmed in another language like Python or Swift, you know enough programming concepts to build a basic Rails application.

## Activities

- Reading and interoperating Ruby
- Translating Swift code to Ruby

## Challenges


## Assignments

In groups of three (3), pick and research one of the following topics to discuss for next class:

- Using libraries
- Error Handling
- Closures aka Blocks
- Structs

Each team is going to present and teach the class on their topics of research. Provide code examples, walkthroughs and practical use cases for each topic of discussion.
